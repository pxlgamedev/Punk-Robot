# Punk-Robot
This is Punk Robot! A Jazz Jackrabbit 2 inspired platformer, with a Comic Book flair!â€‹

Join the intrepid robot hero, Punk Robot, as he tackles the terrors of space!



While 'only' a game jam entry, Punk Robot is a full featured platformer with three difficulty modes, lots of collectibles, some pizzazz, and robot with a heart of gold! No, really, his heart is made of the stuff. He's actually kind of a jerk.

Created in Godot,  an open source game engine, for the github Game Off Game Jam!
